How To Disable Optimus

# First Method. HardWare Method, Download the file in releases and run it
- You'll have to run it as an admin in order for it to work
- No Guarantee this method would work, But it Worked for me
- The tool looks for the registry key in two possible locations on your computer
- It modifies or adds the OverlayTestMode registry keys to either 5 (disabling optimus) or 0 (to enable it.)
- The OverlayTestMode registry value is used by Windows to control certain graphical features related to GPU switching and by setting OverlayTestMode to 5, it forces windows to disable optimus


# Second Method, Buy a HDMI dummy plug, they are around 3-4 dollars on amazon.

# Third, You're good to go. 
Depending on the game, You'll get double the drames you was originally, in my game i had 288 due to optimus, now i get 300-700, mostly at 400-500
